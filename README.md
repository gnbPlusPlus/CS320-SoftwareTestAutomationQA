How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

How do I approach designing software?
--
I design software incrementally and intentionally. I repeatedly refer back to user stories and epics to ground myself in exactly what kind of functionality the user base needs. I write pseudocode, then reference it and adjust things as I compose modular code. For instances when the user inputs a value, like a username, I consider what tests need to be written and what steps need to be taken to check for 1) accurate functionality and 2) security. For example, if the user inputs an invalid username, how does the program react? If the input is unreasonably long, how will the program protect itself against a denial-of-service attack? Keeping these questions in mind is how I remember to write thorough tests and secure code.
